# ip-checker-email-notification
Simple script written in BASH that notifies of of Public IP changes. It checks the current IP address and then compares it to the one last writen to a file (last_ip). If it determines the 2 addresses are different, it'll overwrite the file with the new address and send out on an email notification of the change in IP, along with the new IP address. The script makes use of the SSMTP package, using a smarthost for email delivery - so you have to have that installed and cofigured. The way I run this is on an OpenWrt router, with Cron setting it to run every few hours or so.
